PSN API is a reference implementation of a [community effort](https://andshrew.github.io/PlayStation-Trophies/#/) to document Sony's APIs for PlayStation authorization and trophy metadata. It saves you the hassle of implementing this community reference yourself by offering a strongly-typed, well-tested, and lightweight package.
